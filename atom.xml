    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have tried to get a static blog/website with nanoc earlier, but I have
found that I&#8217;m not really up to making it too well, so I was looking a bit
over on jekyll and octopress, and this seems like something that I really can
use.</p>

<p>So there is one thing that I think that I have learned from this experience, that
is, for getting something done, go with the simplest thing that can work. For learning
just go into something, even though you have to go out on a bit thin ice, the result
may not be that stellar, but for sure you&#8217;ll learn quite a bit in the process.</p>
